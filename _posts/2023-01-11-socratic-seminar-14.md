# Bitcoin Core

**Alternative P2P Networks**

The bitcoin network spans across many different network architectures. The goal of this design is twofold: it offers improved privacy and censorship resistance to node runners as well as increasing the bitcoin network's resilience overall. For years bitcoin ran exclusively on IPv4. This changed when release [v0.7.0](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.7.0) added IPv6 and tor support. I2P support was added in [v22.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/22.0/) and CJDNS in [v23.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/23.0/). In this [blog post](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core), core developer Jon Atack discusses the design of these networks, security and privacy tradeoffs, how to connect your node to these networks, and monitoring tools.

In [part 1](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2022/12/15/pieter-wuille-tim-ruffing-schnorr-musig-part1.html) they discuss Schnorr sigs, multisig, MuSig, and FROST.
