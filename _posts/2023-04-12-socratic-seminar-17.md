We will start with introductions, some basic ground rules, and jump into technical discussions. We will cover aspects of the bitcoin protocol, new research developments, recent news, and
software developments.

Get ready for another exciting month of Bitcoin discussions at our meetup as we dive deep into technical details. This month, we'll cover topics such as Bitcoin Core, Lightning, Privacy, and much more!

Please note the meeting location at 4801 Glenwood Ave suite 200 in Raleigh, right above Fifth Third Bank. They have no idea we're [plotting their demise](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Disaster_Girl.jpg).

# Bitcoin Core

#### Network
[0xB10C](https://github.com/0xB10C) has released a detailed report on the network entity he calls [Linking Lion](https://b10c.me/observations/06-linkinglion/). It appears to be a malicious actor attempting to trace the source node of bitcoin transactions. This can be accomplished by connecting to a large number of bitcoin nodes to collect inv and addr message data. With this data, a dedicated attacker can perform timing analysis to identify the origin node of transaction announcements.

#### OP_VAULT
[Very exciting](https://i.imgur.com/y1cnodp.gif) news for covenant fans! [James O'Beirne](https://github.com/jamesob) has released a new update to his `OP_VAULT` proposal that incorporates techniques from [TLUV](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019419.html), making the protocol more flexible and simpler to use. Additionally, O'Beirne proposes including [OP_CTV](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checktemplateverify/) as a first-class citizen in this proposal.

If you're interested in the technical details, you can read the full [BIP](https://github.com/jamesob/bips/blob/jamesob-23-02-opvault/bip-0345.mediawiki) on O'Beirne's Github page. Alternatively, check out this fantastic [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jamesob/status/1639019107432513537) by O'Beirne for a quick summary. Don't miss out on the latest developments in Bitcoin's covenants!"

#### SegWit
Join us for the first part of our three-part series on SegWit, also known as segregated witness. To gain a clear understanding of Taproot, it's essential to comprehend the fundamentals of SegWit.

In this first part, we'll delve into the necessary background material that led to SegWit. The following two parts will focus more on the technical aspects of SegWit version 1 and version 2. Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your knowledge of Bitcoin's underlying technologies!

# Lightning
#### BOLTs
After three long years the route blinding proposal from [Bastien Teinturier](https://github.com/t-bast) has finally been merged into the [BOLT-04](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md#route-blinding) spec! Route blinding is a technique for achieving recipient privacy by obscuring the final few hops of a payment route using ECDH shared secrets between the recipient and the nodes along the blinded path. Check the [PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/765) or read this nice [summary](https://voltage.cloud/blog/lightning-network-faq/what-are-blinded-paths-and-how-do-they-work/) on the Voltage blog.

# Privacy
#### Payjoin
[payjoin.org](https://payjoin.org) is a new site from [Dan Gould](https://github.com/dangould) explaining the mechanism and use of P2EP, or payjoin, a privacy-preserving on-chain transaction protocol that breaks the [common input ownership hueristic](https://river.com/learn/terms/c/common-input-ownership-heuristic/). The site links directly to the [payjoin SDK](https://github.com/payjoin/payjoin), a rust crate intended for developers to add payjoin support to their projects. payjoin v0.7.0 was also recently released with a [focus on](https://twitter.com/bitgould/status/1640747143823515648) making bitcoin core and LND integration possible.
