- Ordinal Inscriptions: NFTs on bitcoin. ordinals.com is a site to browse ordinal inscriptions, a new NFT scheme built on bitcoin by SF BitDevs host @rodarmor. Ordinals is a scheme to number and track every satoshi based on its issuance date. Inscriptions are a scheme to associate on-chain metadata to a single satoshi ordinal. The data is stored in the tx witness script, leading to heated debates about whether inscriptions are a good or bad thing. The cool part, though, is that in a permissionless system nobody can stop you from minting NFTs as long as you pay the network fee.
