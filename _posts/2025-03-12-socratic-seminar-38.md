We will quickly go over the purpose and goals of this BitDevs chapter. Everyone will have a few moments to introduce themselves. Then we will begin discussion of the bitcoin protocol and recent technical developments.

Special thank you to our sponsor Fidelity Investments!

This group is the Raleigh/Durham fork of the BitDevs NYC meetup. BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and the protocols that power it. You can be well versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will be technical.
