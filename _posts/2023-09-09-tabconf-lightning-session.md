### Splicing merged into CLN
Dusty Daemon's [year long PR](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/5675) to enable [channel splicing](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/) in CLN has finally been merged into master! Hopefully this means users will soon be able to resize lightning channels with no channel downtime or disruption in payment flows. Holla! ðŸ™Œ

### 10101 is building DLCs on Lightning
A new company called [10101](https://10101.finance) (pronounced ten-ten-one) is building DLC capability into lightning. In this [three](https://10101.finance/blog/dlc-to-lightning-part-1/) [part](https://10101.finance/blog/dlc-to-lightning-part-2/) [blog](https://10101.finance/blog/dlc-to-lightning-part-3/) series they explain what DLCs are, how they are enabled on lightning, and how they use virtual channels to accomplish this in practice.

### Blockstream Greenlight enters Closed Beta

Greenlight, a new non-custodial lightning hosting infrastructure project, has [entered closed beta](https://blog.blockstream.com/greenlight-by-blockstream-scalable-non-custodial-lightning-infrastructure-now-open-to-developers/)! Greenlight is [differentiated](https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/) from other cloud lightning solutions thanks to the very low resource footprint of CLN, enabling multiple front ends to share access to a node, simplified recovery, an an off-boarding flow to export your node to a different hosting provider.

### How the Voltage LSP Enhances Privacy for Mutiny Wallet Users

In this blog post [Tony Giorgio](https://iris.to/npub1t0nyg64g5vwprva52wlcmt7fkdr07v5dr7s35raq9g0xgc0k4xcsedjgqv) explains how [Mutiny Wallet](https://www.mutinywallet.com/) leverages the [Voltage LSP](https://voltage.cloud/blog/voltage-announcements/introducing-flow-v2/) to enhance the privacy of their wallet users using just-in-time lightning channels to enable a VPN-like architecture for lightning payments.

### [Lightning-dev] Practical PTLCs, a little more concretely

Greg Sanders, aka [@theinstagibbs](https://twitter.com/theinstagibbs) posted to the mailing list with an initial proposal for a [PTLC](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/ptlc/) implementation. In the gist he considers many potential use cases: single-sig adaptors vs MuSig2, async updates vs sync aka "simplified updates", amount of message re-ordering, and futuristic updates to mempool/consensus (including [APO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash_anyprevout/)).
