# Bitcoin Core

#### Bitcoin Core 24.0 Release Candidate Testing Guide

Bitcoin core contributor [kouloumos](https://twitter.com/kouloumos) put together a [testing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/24.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide) for the [24.0 release candidate](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/24.0-Release-Notes-draft). There's a lot of cool stuff in this release, check out his twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/kouloumos/status/1574483503655403524) to see the highlights in 280 char chunks.

#### [PR merged] wallet: fast rescan with BIP157 block filters for descriptor wallets
[PR #25957](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25957) enables fast wallet rescan using compact block filters, only for descriptor wallets.

#### When Taproot?

[When Taproot?](https://whentaproot.org/) is a cool new site promoting adoption of taproot. It examines the stages of adoption for wallets, exchanges, and other services, why taproot adoption is a good thing, and how you can help.

#### BIP 351
[BIP351](https://privatepayments.org) is a stealth address protocol that makes it possible for two parties to transact using addresses that only they can calculate. It's an improvement over [BIP47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) because it takes measures to conceal the initial notification transaction. However, it still suffers from some of the same drawbacks: the sender must exercise coin control and it requires an on-chain transaction before any payments can be made.

# Lightning

#### Lightning

**CLN Channel Splicing Draft PR**

Dustin Dettmer has opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/5675) to enable [channel splicing](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/) on CLN. There is a long list of TODO items to get this PR across the finish line but this feature represents a massive improvement to LN usability.

#### Advances in Channel Jamming Research

The prolifically productive dream team Gleb Naumenko and Antoine Riard have released a series of research reports examining [channel jamming](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-jamming-attacks/). Read the [lightning-dev post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-August/003673.html) for a brief summary or dive into the [gitbook](https://jamming-dev.github.io/book/) and read the whole shebang.

#### Taro alpha release

[Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/) has released the taro daemon alpha. Despite what the name might imply the taro daemon is not a little monster that steals your root vegetables, it is a tool to issue and transfer assets on bitcoin and lightning. Check out this [blog post](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-9-28-taro-launch/) for the English explanation or [the repo](https://github.com/lightninglabs/taro/) if you want to get technical.

#### Onion Messages and Asynchronous Lightning Payments

[LDK](https://lightningdevkit.org/) developer [vallywal](https://twitter.com/vallywal) explains how onion messages not only unlock bolt12 offers and blinded routes, but the combination of onion messages and PTLCs [enable async payments](https://lightningdevkit.org/blog/onion-messages-demystified/) over lightning that don't lock up network liquidity. Really tho, the awesomest part of this blog post is all the ðŸ”¥ diagrams.


# Privacy

#### Bisq
Buy and sell bitcoin privately and securely on a [Bisq](https://bisq.network/)'s peer-to-peer network.

#### PayJoin
[Payjoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin) is a type of coinjoin where merchant and buyer create a coordinated transaction. Coordination happens with PayToEndPoint [P2EP] concept. PayJoin obfuscates the amount of the transaction and breaks the common ownership heuristic. If the payjoin fails it will fallback to an ordinary transaction. It has the additional benefit of allowing the merchant to consolidate UTXOs.

#### LN-Vortex
[ln-vortex](https://github.com/ln-vortex/ln-vortex) is a tool written in scala that allows coinjoin lightning channel opens. [Ben Carman](https://twitter.com/benthecarman) and [@deregs_](https://twitter.com/deregs_) just opened the first mainnet [vortex coinjoin](https://mempool.space/tx/5027541d328c2bab61e12c0db6df87f8a9f16dc10084042e4f4c962bdcbeb6fa).


# Scalability

#### Taro Skepticism

A critical look at the [scalability properties](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/scaling-problem-for-lightning-labs-taro) of the Taro protocol if deployed on the bitcoin blockchain
