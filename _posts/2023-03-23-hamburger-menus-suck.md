Ah, the hamburger menu, the oft-dreaded "kebab symbol" that's become the bane of users and the go-to lazy design crutch for web developers across the globe. It's that innocuous-looking stack of horizontal lines that pretends to be the epitome of minimalist design, but in reality, is as satisfying as a three-day-old reheated cheeseburger. "Hey, look at me!" it shouts, "I'm the ultimate in simple, accessible design!" But let's be honest, nobody really likes you, hamburger menu. You're about as welcome as a vegan option at a Texas BBQ.

For those unfamiliar with the term "kebab symbol," let me explain: it is a humorous alternative name for the hamburger menu. I guess, because nothing says "user-friendly design" like confusing your audience with food-related terms. But at least when you order a kebab, you know what you're getting – can't say the same for this ambiguous stack of lines.

Now, I understand the kebab symbol was supposed to be a one-size-fits-all solution for mobile-responsive design – a clean, space-saving way to hide menu options behind a universally recognizable symbol. But let's not mince words here: the hamburger menu is an affront to the gods of user experience. A digital travesty that should be banished to the same design purgatory as Comic Sans and blinking text.

The problems with the hamburger menu are many, but let's start with the fact that it's a usability nightmare. How many times have you had to play digital hide-and-seek, trying to figure out where the hamburger menu stashed the link you need? You might as well be hunting for the Ark of the Covenant. A kebab symbol might be more aptly named the "Where's Waldo?" of design.

Sure, the hamburger menu saves precious screen real estate, but at what cost? How many times have you been on a site, clicked the dreaded hamburger, only to be greeted with a laundry list of links longer than the menu at Cheesecake Factory? And you know what? That's just bad design. It's like trying to shove an entire IKEA catalogue into a matchbox.

But wait, there's more! The hamburger menu is a textbook example of mystery meat navigation. Users are forced to click on an ambiguous symbol, only to be greeted with a cacophony of unlabeled icons, each one as cryptic as a hieroglyph. It's like asking someone to solve a Rubik's Cube while blindfolded, underwater, with one hand tied behind their back. For the love of all that is holy, just use some labels!

It's high time we retire the hamburger menu and find a more transparent, accessible, and user-friendly design solution. The world doesn't need another kebab symbol or obscure food-related design metaphor. Let's leave the culinary delights where they belong – on our plates – and put an end to the tyranny of the hamburger menu once and for all.

So, my fellow web-users, join me in saying "no" to the hamburger menu, and let's raise a toast to more intuitive, less infuriating design choices. Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, and hold the kebab symbol. The future of digital design can, and should, be much more palatable.
